steps to add the localization in my app
1-Specify the languages the the app will be supported in the
MaterialApp(
 // step one => supportedLocales: const [
        //The Languages that the app supports
        Locale('en'),
        Locale('ar'),
      ],),

  2-make json files of my languages
  3-Specify the delegates:
 localizationsDelegates: const [
        GlobalMaterialLocalizations
            .delegate, //Responsible for translating some texts in Material
        GlobalWidgetsLocalizations
            .delegate, //Responsible for the direction of the elements
        GlobalCupertinoLocalizations
            .delegate, // Responsible for translating some texts in Cupertino
      ],
  4-Specify the app language base on specific condition in :
  localeResolutionCallback:
          (Locale? currentDeviceLocal, Iterable<Locale> supportedLocals) {
        // this for To prevent the return of an unsupported language in the application.
        for (var supportedLocal in supportedLocals) {
          if (currentDeviceLocal != null &&
              supportedLocal.languageCode == currentDeviceLocal.languageCode) {
            return currentDeviceLocal;
          }
          return supportedLocals.first;
        }
      },
   5-translate my texts between my supported languages by doing:
        5-1- we will do custom delegate its responsible is translating
         the texts in the app by downloading the texts from json Files
        AppLocalizations.delegate and delegate is a class so we will create class for that
